    "## Q1. Measures of Central Tendency\n",
    "\n",
    "The three measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "1. Mean\n",
    "2. Median\n",
    "3. Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q2. Difference between Mean, Median, and Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean is the average, median is the middle value, and mode is the most frequent value. They are used to measure the central tendency of a dataset, providing insights into its typical or central values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q3. Central Tendency of Height Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Given height data: [178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: 177.71875\n",
    "Median: 177.5\n",
    "Mode: 176 and 178 (bimodal)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q4. Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation: 1.615952615\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q5. Measures of Dispersion\n",
    "\n",
    "Range, Variance, and Standard Deviation are measures of dispersion used to describe the spread of a dataset. For example, a high standard deviation indicates greater variability in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q6. Venn Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "A Venn diagram is a visual representation of the relationships between sets. It uses overlapping circles to show commonalities and differences between sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q7. Set Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) A ∩ B: {2, 6}\n",
    "(ii) A ⋃ B: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q8. Skewness\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness in data indicates asymmetry. A right-skewed distribution has a longer right tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q9. Median in Right Skewed Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In right-skewed data, the median is typically less than the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q10. Covariance vs Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance measures the degree of joint variability between two random variables, while correlation standardizes this measurement, making it easier to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q11. Sample Mean Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Mean Formula: \\( \\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \\)\n",
    "Example Calculation: \\( \\bar{X} = \\frac{2+4+6+8+10}{5} = 6 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q12. Relationship in Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are approximately equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q13. Covariance vs Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance measures the direction of the linear relationship between two variables, while correlation additionally measures the strength and standardizes the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q14. Outliers Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can significantly affect the mean and standard deviation, making them less representative of the central tendency and dispersion of the majority of the data.\n"
